The Restaurant Ordering System uses SQL and Java to manage restaurant operations efficiently. In this system, SQL is utilized for database management, including creating tables, defining relationships, and executing queries to handle data related to customers, menu items, orders, and payments. Java, with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), serves as the bridge between the application and the SQL database. It facilitates database connections, executes SQL queries, and processes results within the Java application. The system allows administrators to manage menu items, process customer orders, and handle billing. By using SQL for database operations and Java for application logic and user interface, the system ensures a seamless integration that supports efficient restaurant management and reporting.
